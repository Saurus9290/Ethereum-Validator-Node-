# Introduction
Node operators that wish to participate in validating blocks and identifying the head of the chain deposit ether into a smart contract on Ethereum. They are then paid in ether to run validator software that checks the validity of new blocks received over the peer-to-peer network and apply the fork-choice algorithm to identify the head of the chain.

This guide is designed to help you set up and run an Ethereum validator node on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), following best practices to ensure optimal security and performance.

In Ethereum 2.0, the consensus mechanism is shifted from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) and validator nodes play a critical role in this new PoS system.


## Role and Responsibilities of Validator Nodes


- Validator nodes participate by  proposing new blocks to be added to the blockchain. These proposed blocks contain a batch of transactions and data that need to be validated and added to the Ethereum 2.0 chain.

- Validator nodes also validate the proposed blocks created by other validators. They check the transactions within the block, verify their validity, and confirm that the cryptographic signatures are correct.
- In Ethereum 2.0, validators also participate in attesting to the validity of existing blocks which involves confirming that a specific block is valid and should be added to the chain

- Validator nodes need to maintain a reliable and responsive network connection because Consistent connectivity ensures that they can efficiently participate in the block proposal and validation process, as well as share attestations with the network.
- When the Ethereum network undergoes upgrades or hard forks, validator node operators need to ensure their nodes are compatible with the new protocols and versions.





## Rewards Penalties and Slashing

- Validators receive rewards for their participation and correct behavior
- Validator nodes must follow the network rules and avoid any behavior that could be considered malicious. Violating the rules or attempting to manipulate the network can result in slashing, where the validator loses a portion of their staked funds as a penalty

The below points shows the rewards and penalties

- So if validator validates the invalid tx then it would be slashed which means forceful removal of a validator from the network and an associated loss of their staked ether
- If a validator node is offline and unable to attest to blocks, it will slowly lose a portion of its staked ETH over time.
- If validator validates the correct tx then it would be rewarded 


Therefore, being a validator node in Ethereum 2.0 has both potential rewards and risks, and it’s crucial to ensure that your node is consistently online and not engaging in any malicious activities.
## Ethereum Validator Requirements

### Basic requirements for validator
- Firstly,  make sure that my hard drive met the minimum criteria so that we could store the necessary data.
- Secondly, to have the right CPU and RAM specifications to be able to run the necessary software adequately.
- Lastly, need a reliable internet connection to ensure that I was always in sync with the network.

### Hardware Requirements:
1.  Memory (RAM): Ethereum validator nodes benefit from having sufficient RAM. A minimum of 8 GB is recommended, but having 16 GB or more will provide better performance, especially when running other processes alongside the validator node.

Depending on the validator the RAM can vary
 For prysm 4GB atleast
- For lighthouse 16GB
- For Teku 32GB 

2. Storage: 1TB SSD Solid-state drives (SSDs) are highly recommended for storing the Ethereum blockchain data and related files. The blockchain database can grow significantly over time, so having enough storage space and read/write speed is important.
3. Internet Connection:To become an Ethereum validator, meeting Internet requirements is vital. A reliable and fast internet connection is necessary for running a node 24/7 for transaction validation. With a poor internet connection, the node may go offline, potentially causing penalties or even slashing. Validators are advised to use wired ethernet connections instead of wireless due to higher stability and security. Moreover, providers that offer static IPs or that do not restrict traffic flow from blockchain nodes should be preferred. Validators must also ensure port forwarding on their router for proper communication with other nodes. It’s also essential to avoid using VPNs or firewalls that alter the IP address as this can lead to network disconnection and impact validation. Therefore, it becomes imperative for validators to ensure their connectivity meets the minimum required standards regarding speed and reliability. Otherwise, they may end up losing rewards or facing penalties impacting their profit margins.
4. Operating System: Validator nodes can run on various operating systems, including Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Choose a stable and well-supported operating system.

### Software Requirements:
1. Ethereum 2.0 Client: Choose a reputable Ethereum 2.0 client implementation such as Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, or Teku. These clients provide the necessary software to connect to the Ethereum 2.0 network, propose blocks, and participate in validation.
2. Beacon Chain and Validator Software: Ethereum 2.0 consists of the Beacon Chain and the Shard Chains. Validator nodes run the Beacon Chain client and validator software. You'll need to set up your validator keys and configure the software accordingly.
3. Eth2 Deposit: Before becoming a validator, you'll need to deposit the required amount of ETH (32 ETH) into the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. This can be done using the official Ethereum Foundation deposit portal or third-party services.
4. Docker (Optional): Some users may choose to run their Ethereum client using Docker, a platform that packages software into standardized units called containers. This makes the software easier to install, run, and upgrade.

## Consensus client and Execution client

### Consensus client
The consensus client, also known as the beacon chain client, manages the Proof of Stake protocol, the validator’s duties, and the organization of validators into committees.

- Prysm: Prysm is developed by Prysmatic Labs and is one of the most widely used Ethereum 2.0 clients. It's written in Go and designed for efficiency and ease of use. Prysm offers a user-friendly command-line interface and comprehensive documentation.
- Lighthouse: Lighthouse is developed by Sigma Prime and is implemented in Rust. It emphasizes performance and security. Lighthouse is known for its modular architecture and support for hardware security modules (HSMs).
- Teku: Teku is developed by ConsenSys and is also implemented in Java. It's designed with enterprise-level features and focuses on compatibility and ease of deployment. Teku supports features like automatic slashing protection and metrics reporting.
- Nimbus: Nimbus is developed by Status and is implemented in Nim. It aims to provide a lightweight client suitable for resource-constrained devices, like smartphones and embedded systems. It's designed to be highly efficient and easily portable.

Each of these clients allows you to run a validator node and participate in the Ethereum 2.0 consensus mechanism. They provide instructions on setting up, configuring, and monitoring your validator node. Keep in mind that the choice of client depends on factors such as your technical proficiency, hardware resources, and specific requirements.

### Execution client
The execution client, often referred to as the Eth1 client, handles the execution of transactions and smart contracts. Even in Ethereum 2.0, execution continues to work the way it does in Ethereum 1.0.
 
Some popular Ethereum 1.0 execution clients include:


- Geth: A Go-based Ethereum client that supports the execution of smart contracts and transactions on the Ethereum network. It's widely used and has both a full node and a light client version.
- Parity: Another Ethereum client that supports the execution of smart contracts and transactions. Parity was developed in Rust and offers both full node and light client options.
- Nethermind: An Ethereum client implemented in C# that provides smart contract execution capabilities along with other Ethereum-related features.
- Besu: An Ethereum client developed by ConsenSys in Java that supports smart contract execution and is focused on enterprise use cases.

For the purposes of this guide, we’re recommending the combination of Lighthouse for the consensus client and Geth for the execution client.

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and configuring a validator on Google Cloud Platform using the Lighthouse consensus client and Geth as the execution client.

- Set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) instance
Create a new Compute Engine instance on GCP. Choose an instance with a minimum of 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 100 GB SSD storage. You might consider using a region close to you for better network latency.
-  SSH into your instance and update it
SSH into your GCP instance. Once inside, ensure everything is up to date by running:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
- Install Docker
To ensure smooth updates and running, we’ll run our clients using Docker.

--> First, update your apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

--> Next, add Docker’s official GPG key:

curl -fsSL <https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg> | sudo apt-key add -

-->Then, set up the stable Docker repository:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] <https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu> $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

-->Finally, update the apt package index, and install the latest 
version of Docker CE:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce

- Install and Configure Geth

- Install and Configure Lighthouse

First, create a directory to store validator data:

mkdir ~/lighthouse-data

Then, pull the Lighthouse Docker image:

docker pull sigp/lighthouse

Run the Lighthouse beacon node:

docker run -d --name lighthouse-beacon -v ~/lighthouse-data:/root/.lighthouse -p 9000:9000 -p 5052:5052 sigp/lighthouse lighthouse beacon --http --eth1-endpoints <http://localhost:8545>

This will start the beacon node, connect to the Geth node, and begin syncing the Eth2 chain.

- Import Validator Keys

After you have generated your validator keys following the Eth2 launchpad instructions, you can import them to Lighthouse.

Assuming your keys are in ~/validator_keys, import them as follows:
docker exec -it lighthouse-beacon lighthouse account validator import --directory ~/validator_keys

Follow the prompts to complete the import. After successful import, restart the Lighthouse Docker container:

docker restart lighthouse-beacon

Your validator is now running and will start validating when the beacon chain reaches the activation epoch of your validator.

### Acquiring 32 ETH

To acquire the required 32 ETH for staking in the Ethereum 2.0 network, you'll need to purchase ETH through a cryptocurrency exchange or other platforms that facilitate buying and selling digital assets. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to acquire the necessary ETH for staking:

1. Choose a Cryptocurrency Exchange: Select a reputable cryptocurrency exchange that supports trading in your region. Some popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, and Bitfinex.
2. Create an Account: Sign up for an account on the chosen exchange. Follow the verification process required by the exchange to comply with regulatory guidelines.
3. Verify Your Identity: Complete any identity verification requirements, such as providing your identification documents, proof of address, and other KYC (Know Your Customer) information.
4. Deposit Funds: Deposit fiat currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) into your exchange account. Different exchanges offer various methods for funding your account, including bank transfers, credit/debit cards, and other payment options.
5. Buy Ethereum (ETH): Once your account is funded, navigate to the trading section of the exchange and look for the ETH trading pair. Buy the amount of ETH you need to reach the required 32 ETH.
6. Withdraw to a Wallet: After purchasing ETH, it's recommended to withdraw your newly acquired ETH to a personal wallet that you control. This provides you with better security and control over your funds. Use a secure Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask, Ledger, or Trezor.
7. Set Up an Ethereum 2.0 Validator: To stake your ETH in Ethereum 2.0 and become a validator, you'll need to set up an Ethereum 2.0 validator node using the chosen client (such as Prysm, Lighthouse, etc.). Follow the instructions provided by the client's documentation to set up your validator keys and configure the node.
8. Deposit ETH to Ethereum 2.0 Contract: Once your validator node is ready, you'll need to deposit the required 32 ETH to the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. This can be done using the Ethereum Foundation's official deposit portal or other authorized services.

### Generating Validator Keys
Validator keys are generated through the official Eth2 Launchpad. Follow these steps to generate your validator keys:

1. Visit the Eth2 Launchpad site for the Ethereum network you want to join (for example, https://launchpad.ethereum.org for the mainnet).
2. Follow the instructions on the site. These instructions will guide you to generate your validator keys offline using the official Ethereum key generation tool.
3. The key generation process will give you a deposit file and a password for each validator you create. It’s crucial to keep these secure and backed up, as losing them will result in the permanent loss of your staked ETH.

### Depositing the ETH into the Ethereum Deposit Contract

To deposit ETH into the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract and participate in staking, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Ethereum 2.0 Validator Node:
Before you deposit ETH, make sure you have set up your Ethereum 2.0 validator node using one of the supported client implementations, such as Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, or Teku. Generate your validator keys as part of the setup process.

2. Get Your Ethereum 1.0 ETH Ready:
Ensure you have the ETH you want to stake available in your Ethereum 1.0 wallet. You'll need a minimum of 32 ETH to participate in staking. Make sure your wallet is compatible with the deposit process. A wallet like MetaMask can be used for this purpose.

3. Use the Official Deposit Contract:
Visit the official Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract portal. This portal will guide you through the process of submitting your ETH for staking. Make sure you're using the official Ethereum Foundation website to avoid scams.

4. Connect Your Wallet:
The deposit contract portal will ask you to connect your Ethereum 1.0 wallet using a browser extension like MetaMask. Make sure your wallet is unlocked and ready to interact with the portal.
Deposit ETH:
In the deposit portal, you'll find a section where you can input the amount of ETH you want to stake. This amount should be a multiple of 32 ETH. The portal will calculate how many validators you can create with the entered amount. The portal will also show you the total amount, including a small deposit fee.

5. Generate Validator Keys:
After confirming the deposit amount, the portal will guide you through the process of generating your validator keys. Follow the instructions to create and save these keys securely.

6. Confirm and Sign Transactions:
As part of the deposit process, you'll need to sign a series of transactions with your Ethereum 1.0 wallet. These transactions will confirm your intention to stake and will initiate the deposit process. Confirm each transaction using your wallet.

7. Wait for Confirmation:
Once your transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum 1.0 chain, your deposited ETH will be held in the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. You will receive a confirmation when this process is completed.

8. Activate Validator:
Now that you have deposited your ETH, you'll need to activate your validator node in your chosen Ethereum 2.0 client. Follow the instructions provided by your client's documentation to activate your validator using the keys you generated earlier.

### Monitoring Node Performance
You can monitor your validator’s performance through the command line interface or through a visual dashboard using tools such as Grafana.

- Command Line Interface: Both Lighthouse and Geth provide detailed logs that you can use to monitor your validator. These logs can provide details on your node’s sync status, attestations, and any errors that may occur.
- Grafana Dashboard: Lighthouse comes with built-in support for Prometheus and Grafana, which you can set up to monitor your validator in a more visual and user-friendly manner. This can help you monitor your node’s performance over time, and quickly identify any issues or anomalies.
 

### Managing Updates
Updates to the Ethereum client software are common and important to apply. Updates often provide important bug fixes, security enhancements, and new features. The use of Docker makes the update process fairly straightforward:

1. Pull the new Docker image with the updated client version.
docker pull sigp/lighthouse

2. Stop and remove the current container.

docker  stop lighthouse-beacon

docker rm lighthouse-beacon

3. Start the new container using the newly pulled image, remembering to use the same command line parameters as your previous container.

docker run -d --name lighthouse-beacon -v ~/lighthouse-data:/root/.lighthouse -p 9000:9000 -p 5052:5052 sigp/lighthouse lighthouse beacon --http --eth1-endpoints <http://localhost:8545>

### Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting usually involves interpreting the logs from your client or seeking help from the wider Ethereum community.
- Understanding Logs: The logs from your client can often provide clues about what’s going wrong. Both Geth and Lighthouse provide verbose logs that you can use to diagnose issues.
- Seeking Help: If you’re unable to solve a problem on your own, you can seek help from the Ethereum community. Both Geth and Lighthouse have active communities on platforms like Discord, GitHub, and StackExchange where you can ask questions and get help from others.

### Security
- Key Management: Never share your keys with anyone. Store them securely, and maintain backups in multiple safe locations. Consider using a hardware wallet for added security.
- Firewall: Set up a firewall to allow only necessary traffic to your server. You should only allow SSH from known IP addresses.
- Updates: Regularly update your software to benefit from the latest security patches. This includes your Ethereum clients (Lighthouse and Geth), Docker, and your server’s operating system.
- Monitor Logs: Regularly check the logs of your Ethereum clients for any suspicious activity.


### Performance
- Regular Updates: Keep your Ethereum clients and other software up-to-date to benefit from performance optimizations.
- Hardware Resources: Monitor your server’s resource usage (CPU, memory, storage, network). If you’re consistently reaching the limits, consider upgrading your server.


In Ethereum 2.0, managing withdrawal accounts is an important aspect of staking. Here are some best practices:
- Security: Withdrawal keys should be kept in the utmost security. It’s recommended to store your withdrawal keys offline or in a hardware wallet.
- Backups: Make sure to have secure and redundant backups of your withdrawal keys. Losing these keys means you won’t be able to access your staked ETH.
- Separation of Concerns: The withdrawal keys and the keys used for validating are different. This separation of concerns adds an additional layer of security. Make sure you do not use the same keys for both purposes.
- Phishing Awareness: Be aware of phishing attacks and never share your withdrawal keys with anyone. Always ensure you are on the correct website and that you trust the software you are using.
- Withdrawal Delay: Understand that withdrawals in Ethereum 2.0 aren’t immediate. It takes a certain amount of time to withdraw after you’ve decided to stop validating.
- No Early Withdrawals: At the time of writing, it’s important to note that withdrawals aren’t yet enabled on the Ethereum 2.0 network. Always stay updated on the official Ethereum website.
